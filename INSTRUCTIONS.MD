# Creation Process

In this project, I used React to implement the concept of Single Page Applications (SPA), providing a fluid and interactive experience.

To search for Pokémon information and carry out training, I used a specialized API: [https://treinamento.inteligenciadascoisas.com.br/](https://treinamento.inteligenciadascoisas.com.br/).

For styling, I used Styled Components, allowing me to modify specific components without affecting the others in a practical and efficient way.

During the process, I used these tools because I learned them throughout my studies and work, which proved to be quite useful.
